##  Key Features

### **1. Protocol Generator**
- Generates innovative protocol blueprints—e.g., FluxNet, CryoMesh, HyperPulse-X.
- Includes structured details such as:
  - Key Features (latency optimization, encryption style, energy model, routing mechanism)
  - Predicted Metrics (latency, throughput, security, scalability)
  - Pseudocode or blueprint-like descriptions

### **2. Visualization Dashboard**
- Interactive charts to understand protocol trade-offs:
  - **Latency vs Throughput** (line chart)
  - **Security Strength** (radar/spider chart)
  - **Energy Efficiency** (bar chart)

### **3. Archive System**
- Saves and displays every generated protocol.
- Supports side-by-side comparison between two protocols.
- Export options: **JSON** and **PDF**.

### **4. Simulation Mode (Experimental)**
- Animates a network diagram with flowing packet visuals.
- Allows visual differentiation in packet behavior:
  - Smooth, fast flow for protocols like FluxNet
  - Encrypted “lock” visuals for CryoMesh
  - Bursty packet sequences for HyperPulse-X

### **5. Cyberpunk Visual Design**
- Dark mode with neon accents and subtle glitch effects.
- Futuristic, immersive aesthetic helps embody your vision of next-gen network research.
